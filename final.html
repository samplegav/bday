            <h3 class="words">I kinda am out of words. I really have no idea what to tell. So firstly, happy birthday ammuse. Have a wonderful year ahead of you and enjoy a lot. I’m really glad I ended up meeting you and that we became in a relationship. These four years have been wonderful, and I hope the rest would be even better than this. <br><br>  I hope my baby puts in good amounts of efforts in all areas and becomes successful always. I’m always gonna be watching you and would be there to support you, but expect it as tough love, I’m not gonna go so easy on you. And anyway, I hope we can get together soon, until then take care of yourself well, don’t get into trouble, be healthy, study well, put in good efforts for everything okk. I love you ^3^</h3>
